### Capturing Data returned from the API.
* With your fetch() request in place, we will need to read the data that were returned in the response.
* Console log the response after the fetch to check the promise. 
* Promises are callback functions. 
* JS sets fetch() requests aside and continues implemented the rest of your code, until the fetch callback is ready. This is asynchronous code. 
* Async code is referred to as AJAX. 
* With a response in place, look at the response object that is logged.
